Stage 1 Backend- Number Classification API
Resources
Fun fact API: http://numbersapi.com/#42
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)

Task Description
Create an API that takes a number and returns interesting mathematical properties about it, along with a fun fact.

Requirements
Technology Stack:
Use any programming language or framework of your choice (See Sharp (C #), PHP :elephant:, Python :snake:, Go :runner::skin-tone-5:, Java :coffee:, JS/TS :nauseated_face:)

Must be deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint

Must handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Must return responses in JSON format

Version Control:
Code must be hosted on GitHub

Repository must be public

Must include a well-structured README.md .................

API Specification
Endpoint: GET** <your-domain.com>/api/classify-number?number=371
Required JSON Response Format (200 OK):
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,  // sum of its digits
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = " //gotten from the numbers API
}
Required JSON Response Format (400 Bad Request)
{
    "number": "alphabet",
    "error": true
}
Acceptance Criteria
Functionality
Accepts GET requests with a number parameter.

Returns JSON in the specified format.

Accepts all valid integers as the only possible inputs

Provides appropriate HTTP status codes.
Code Quality
Organized code structure.
Basic error handling and input validation.
Avoids hardcoded values.
Documentation
Complete README.
Deployment
Publicly accessible and stable API.
Fast response time (< 500ms).
Submission Mode:
Submit your task through the designated submission form. Ensure you've:
Hosted the API on a platform of your choice.
Double-checked all requirements and acceptance criteria.
Tested your API thoroughly before submission.
Thoroughly reviewed your work to ensure accuracy, functionality, and adherence to the specified guidelines before you submit it.
Submission Deadline:
The deadline for submissions is 6th February, 2025 11:59 PM WAT (GMT +1). Late submissions will not be entertained.
Additional Note
Use the math type from the Numbers API to get the fun fact.
This task weighs 10 marks. An average mark is needed to proceed to the next stage.
The possible combinations for the properties field:
["armstrong", "odd"] - if the number is both an Armstrong number and odd
["armstrong", “even”] - if the number is an Armstrong number and even
["odd"] - if the number is not an Armstrong number but is odd
[”even”] - if the number is not an Armstrong number but is even
:loudspeaker: Important Reminder
Read, read, and read again! Ensure you fully understand the task requirements, API specifications, and acceptance criteria before starting. Double-check your work to ensure it meets all the guidelines and is free of errors.
